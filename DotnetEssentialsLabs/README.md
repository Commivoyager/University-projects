A collection of C# console applications and utility classes demonstrating key .NET concepts: domain modeling with a Book service and binary storage, a custom thread-pool (TaskQueue), parallel file copying, synchronization primitives (Mutex, OSHandle), reflection-based assembly inspection, buffered logging (LogBuffer), parallel delegate execution (Parallel.WaitAll), a custom attribute exporter (ExportClass), and a generic dynamic list (DynamicList<T>)
